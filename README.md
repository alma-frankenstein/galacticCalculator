# Galactic Calculator 

#### Created by Alma Frankenstein, September 2020

## Description
This app allows users to calculate their relative age, based on the length of years on different planets. It also allows them to estimate their life expectancy, and then see how many years they're likely to have left (or how many years they've already passed the expectancy).


## Specs

* Take a person's age in years
  * input: 32
  * output: 32

* Return their age in Mercury years (as integer)
  * input: 32
  * output: 142
  

* Return their age in Venus years (as integer)
  * input: 32
  * output: 52

* Return their age in Mars years (as integer)
  * input: 32
  * output: 17

* Return their age in Jupiter years(as integer)
  * input: 32
  * output: 3

* Estimate the user's life expectancy based on survey questions. Start with 90, subtract 5 if they smoke, and 10 if they live on a toxic waste dump
  * input: they live on a toxic waste dump, but don't smoke
  * output: 80 years

* Determine how many years the user has left on each planet
  * input: they are 40 years old on Earth, and expected to live to 90
  * output: they have 208 years left on Mercury

* If they've already outlived their life expectancy, tell them by how much
  * input: user is 100, but their expectancy was only 90
  * output: they are 42 Mercury years over their life expectancy
